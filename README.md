To make the introduction, we are a group of software engineering students. We want to leverage the secondhand stuff sales trend to give the users a tool to sell items in a more funny way. Due to those facts, mixed with our necessity to build an android app for a university subject, Sellverse is born.

Sellverse is an application developed for android powered by android studio. It is an online shop where you can sell products by bidding.
The whole application will be in English, both the documentation and the code, and it will be internationalised.
